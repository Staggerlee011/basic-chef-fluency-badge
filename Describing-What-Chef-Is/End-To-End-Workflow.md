## How all Chef products, features and technologies fit together
Audit (InSpec/Compliance) > Remediate (Chef/Workflow/Habitat) > Certify (Visibility)


## The workflow scope
Is used to create pipeline (Same as Jenkins etc)


## The compliance scope
Used to audit nodes


## The Chef Automate scope
Chef automate is an attempt to create a central 1 source for all your node configuraiton, validation and compliance needs


## How Chef Automate enhances DevOps behaviors
Chef automate gives a central point for team collaboration. Chef Server gives you IaC, InSpec gives you TDD, Testing, Workflow gives you a automated pipeline for CI/CD


## The aspects of Chef that are relevant to security and compliance teams
You can use InSpec / Compliance to monitor and audit your nodes

Chef allows for IaC, TDD


## The aspects of Chef that are relevant to operations teams
Chef allows for IaC, complaince and auditing, standardised deployment.


## The aspects of Chef that are relevant to change advisory boards
you can use the workflow to enforce CAB changes and visibility will give a visual state of affairs

Chef uses a process of Test and Repair, this means that all servers will be in the same state.
