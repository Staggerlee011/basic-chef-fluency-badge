## What the advantages are of defining infrastructure as code		
The advantage of IAC is that manual work can be completed incorrectly. mistakes can be made following step by step guides where as executing the code should be idempotent


## The reasons for defining infrastructure as code
Idempotence, control, standardization.


## The difference between rolling back and rolling forward
### Rolling Back 
If you roll out new code and there is an issue, you can roll back and return to the old version

### Rolling Forward
If you roll out new code and there is an issue, you create a fix and roll that out to resolve the probelm
